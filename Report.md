## Insights

#### Which areas of Manhattan had the largest number of 311 noise complaints? What are some reasons you can think of for these trends?

Areas in Lower Manhattan such as Chinatown, Financial District, East Village, Garment District and Upper areas such as West 86th Street and Yorkville have the largest number of 311 noise complaints. One reason for large number of complaints in these areas can be due to the fact that a large number of population live in these areas. For example, according to 2010 NTA density data, Yorkville and East Village are some of the most densest areas in Manhattan with more than 150 people living per acre[1]. Neighbourhoods with large populations can often have large number of complaints as people live close to each other and minor disturbances can be a major issue for other people living in the area. Secondly, areas such as Yorkville is one of the most affluent neighbourhoods in Manhattan and the rental prices in the neighbourhood is expensive when compared to other places in Manhattan. The residents in the community would expect a noise free neighbourhood due to the amount of money they pay for rent in these areas. Thus, this fact might encourage residents to register noise complaints whenever they are disturbed. Thirdly, areas such as Chinatown and Financial District is full of economic activity during the day causing a lot of sounds to the residents of the area. This can be a reason for a large number of noise complaints in the area. Fourthly, areas such as Chinatown and Garment District are major tourist spots making it noisy and bustling with activity day and night. Due to this reason, a large number of noise complaints can arise.  

#### What are some trends you noticed regarding the descriptor for noise complaints?

Most of the 'other complaints'(which include noise from cars, other machinery sounds) come from dense neighbourhoods such as Yorkville and East Village which are the densest neighborhoods in Manhattan. This can be found true when compared with neighborhoods in Upper Manhattan. Areas around Harlem do not have large number of complaints due to the fact that the neighborhoods in Harlem are more less densely populated. The second trend found in the maps (Deliverable 1&2) is that most of the complaints are construction complaints. It is also interesting to note that most of construction complaints come from areas where there are ongoing renovation of roads and parks. For example, the construction in East Village is have been ongoing for months causing disruption of traffic and costing shops in the road less sales [2]. This shows that in areas where the city has proposed/ongoing construction or renovation, we can see a rise of noise complaints in particular construction. The third trend noticed is that we can see a large number of ice-cream truck noise near tourist spots. The prime example is Central Park area where there is a  presence of large number of ice-cream trucks catering to tourists and residents visiting the park. Similarly, the same trend of ice-cream truck noise complaints can be found near other tourist spots. Fourthly, it can also be observed that most animal noise complaints are observed in less dense areas and areas near parks such as Central Park and areas above Central Park which can be observed in maps (deliverable 1 and 3). Fifthly, most of loud music/party noise complaints arise from areas with large number of restuarants/bars. This can be seen in map 1, particularly near the Battery Park area[3].

#### How did the additional data and map changed or reinforced your insights from Q(1)?

The additional data added was the population of each neighborhood based on NTA in Manhattan. In QGIS, further calculations were made to find the proportion betweeen the number of complaints in each neighborhood and the population of each neighborhood. Then, the data from Map1 which is the type of complaints were added along with data calculated to produce Map 3. The additonal data and calculation immensely helped to understand the proportion of complaints and the types of complaints from the basis of density. This allowed me to understand why certain areas in Lower Manhattan such as Chinatown, Financial District, East Village, Garment District and Upper areas such as West 86th Street and Yorkville have the largest number of complaints. It helped me to understand why there is a rise in certain type of complaints near a area such as the large number of ice-cream truck noise complaints near Central Park area as explained above. It is allowed me as a viewer to research more about the areas with particular complaints to understand the geography and the economic activity in that area.
